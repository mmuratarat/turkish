# Welcome!
If you’ve managed to stumble across this blog it means you share an interest in all things statistics, data science/analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering just like I do! I appreciate any and all feedback on any of the content I post. If I've made an error or if you have a suggestion, please, do not hesitate to send me an email!

# Background & Bio

Hello! I'm Murat, PhD-level educated, bilingual statistician and data scientist, who works to design, develop and implement advanced data-driven predictive methods, powered by machine learning and deep learning algorithms, to provide actionable insights from large volumes of real-world, structured and unstructured data in order to satisfy the business needs / goals for decision making across different industries and roles. I have a deep understanding of best data analytic practices to solve complex problems and I continuously improve myself and learn new emerging technologies, tools, and platforms to add new skills to my skill set. 

I completed my Ph.D. dissertation, titled ”Advances and Applications in Deep Learning” under the supervision of [Dr. Michel Ballings](http://ballings.co/){:target="_blank"} (mb@utk.edu) at [Department of Business Analytics & Statistics](https://haslam.utk.edu/business-analytics-statistics){:target="_blank"} of the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville](https://utk.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

I was a Master of Science student at [Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.hacettepe.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"} of [Hacettepe University](https://www.hacettepe.edu.tr/){:target="_blank"} in Ankara, Turkey. I received my degree at the same department in the division of Operational Research. I completed my thesis entitled "Support Vector Machines/Regression" under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Turhan Menteş. 

My passion currently resides in modeling big data using supervised learning and unsupervised learning methods (such as machine learning and deep learning algorithms), Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), Transformer-based models on Hugging Face, Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and so on.
